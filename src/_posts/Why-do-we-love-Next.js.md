The Next.js frontend framework has been around for only a couple years, but it is already one of the most popular tools in the React ecosystem. As big React users ourselves, we also love it and use it a lot in our everyday work. In this article, we’re going to show you why and how Next.js can improve the performance, UX and SEO of your app. We’re also going to discuss the best kinds of projects for Next.js and various ways to acquire developers skilled in Next.js.

Did you know that over 50 percent of all respondents of our State of Frontend 2020 report admitted to using Next.js in their projects? This makes Next.js one of the most ubiquitous pieces of software in modern frontend development next to the likes of React, Vue or jQuery. We’re soon going to go over the reasons behind this popularity. But first, let’s get one thing out  of the way.

We love Next.js
At The Software House, we really like working with Next.js. To the point that it is one of the technologies listed in our Technology Radar in the “Common” category. As it says, these technologies are “our bread and butter.” This means that we believe in them and consider them to have great potential for the future as well and as a result, we made a big part of our technology stack.

A big reason for that is the fact that Next.js is built on top of React – a frontend development library for building user interfaces, which is our first choice when it comes to web applications.

But it wouldn’t be enough if Next.js wasn’t really good at what it does… right – so what does it do exactly!? In order to explain it, we need to go over a couple terms.
